# jMineWASM
This project is a refined version of [my original 3D block game](https://github.com/jackkimmins/3D-Cube-Game), using C++ and OpenGL, compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten and utilising WebGL2 for GPU rendering and much better performance compared to my first attempt.

## Features
Features of this project include:
- Perlin World Generation
- Caves and Ore Generation
- Unbreakable Bedrock Layer
- Ambient Occlusion (AO)
- Basic Block Interaction

## Demo
This game can be played without install in modern web browsers.
Demo URL: [https://jmine.appserver.uk/](https://jmine.appserver.uk/)

## Build
Please see the project's [Makefile](https://github.com/jackkimmins/jMineWASM/blob/main/Makefile) for a general idea of how to compile. Although technically possible to compile on Windows, please use Linux! ðŸ˜‡
